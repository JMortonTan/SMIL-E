## Project Name
SMIL-E is a mobile camera robot inspired by the tourists of Roosevelt Island.
Each year, thousands of tourists from all over the world come to Roosevelt Island to view the cherry blossam bloom during the spring.
With backdrops of the Manhattan skyline and Cornell Tech's stunning architecture, the beatiful pink and white petals are the subject of untold photographs.

What if there was a robot capable of capturing the moments for you?  What if we captured genuine moments without the need for posing and interrupting our enjoyment of the scenic beauty?
