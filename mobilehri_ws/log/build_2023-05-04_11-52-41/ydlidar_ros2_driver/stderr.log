[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:25 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findydlidar_sdk.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ydlidar_sdk", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ydlidar_sdk" with
  any of the following names:

    ydlidar_sdkConfig.cmake
    ydlidar_sdk-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ydlidar_sdk" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ydlidar_sdk_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ydlidar_sdk" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
